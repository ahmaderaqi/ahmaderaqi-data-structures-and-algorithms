# Linked list FOR CODE CHALLENGE 7
linked list is a type of dynamic data structure, we will get the value of and index but started at the end of the list

## Approach & Efficiency
get the value of a specific index of a linked list but starting at the end of the list.
Algorithm:
To use linked list,
1- count the number of elements
2- check the edge cases and handle them
3- loop throw the linked list depends on the #of elements and the index that we want(counter-n-1)
4- return the value of the index
Big O
time complexity is O(N)
space complexity is O(1)
