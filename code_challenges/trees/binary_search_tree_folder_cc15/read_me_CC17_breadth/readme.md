## Approach & Efficiency
traversing the tree in breath 

# algorithm
1. Create an empty queue to store nodes.
2. Enqueue the root node into the queue.
3. Repeat steps 4-6 until the queue becomes empty.
4. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
5. Process the dequeued node (e.g., print its value, perform some operation).
6. Enqueue the children of the dequeued node into the queue (if they exist).
7. The traversal is complete when the queue becomes empty.



# big O
time complexity of O(n)
space complexity of O(n)
