## Approach & Efficiency
merge two linked lists but in twisted way
Algorithm
1- link the first node of the first ll with the first node of the second ll
2- link the first node of the second ll with the second node of the first ll and so on
3- return the linked list

Big O:
time complexity is O(n)
space complexity is O(1)
