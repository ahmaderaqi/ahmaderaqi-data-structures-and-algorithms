## Approach & Efficiency
finding the index of an element in an array with lower time and space complexity.

Algorithm
1- start from the middle of the array
2- if the value is equal to the middle return it
3- else if the value is greater than the middle go to the right and repeat step 1,2.

else if the value is less than the middle go to the left and repeat step 1,2

Big O
time complexity is O(logN)
